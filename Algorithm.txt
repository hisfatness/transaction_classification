Sure, let's break down the provided code into a step-by-step algorithm:

### Algorithm for Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest

**Step 1: Load and Preprocess Data**
- Load the financial dataset from a CSV file.
- Check for missing values in the dataset.
- Impute missing values using the mean of the respective feature (e.g., 'Amount').
- Normalize the data, if necessary.

**Step 2: Train Isolation Forest Model**
- Initialize an Isolation Forest model with a contamination rate of 1% to identify potential anomalies.
- Train the Isolation Forest model on the preprocessed dataset.

**Step 3: Predict Anomalies**
- Predict outliers/fraudulent transactions using the trained Isolation Forest model.
- Create a new column, 'Fraudulent,' to store the predicted labels (-1 for potential fraud, 1 for normal transactions).

**Step 4: Feature Engineering**
- Optionally, perform feature engineering. In the provided code, a new feature 'TransactionHour' is created based on the 'Timestamp.'

**Step 5: Analyze and Visualize Results**
- Identify potential fraudulent transactions by filtering rows where 'Fraudulent' is -1.
- Print a summary of monthly spending for June based on transaction type.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Suppress warnings to improve readability.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using classification report metrics.

**Step 6: Visualize Anomaly Scores Over Time**
- Convert the 'Timestamp' to datetime format.
- Generate anomaly scores for each transaction using the decision function of the Isolation Forest model.
- Create a scatter plot to visualize anomaly scores over time, differentiating between normal and potential fraudulent transactions.

**Step 7: Visualize Anomaly
